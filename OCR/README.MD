# PyTesser OCR 

Just testing out the pytesser module and got it working against a Chinese shipping site: http://www.ems.com.cn/. 

Captcha coming in
![Captcha1](test.png "Captcha1")

Captcha cleaned up
![Captcha2](result.png "Captcha2")

And then now the program has no problem seeing each character.
